# Tic-Tac-Toe
A Tic Tac Toe game that can be played in the browser. Here I leverage the use of JavaScript objects, scope, factory functions and module patterns. 

To do:
1. Store the Game board as an array inside an 'Game board' object.
2. Store the players inside another object  
3. Create another object to control the flow of the game  
4. Try tucking as much as inside factories.
5. If you need a single instance of anything example a Game board, the display container etc. wrap that inside an IIFE.
